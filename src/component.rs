// I have not found a better / more idomatic way to solve this. I have tried:
//
// 1. Adding a macro to enable `#[derive(Prepare)]` using `proc_macro`.
//    This adds a second `impl Component for Foo` that implements `prepare`,
//    but splitting the required methods into two `impl` blocks like that is not allowed.
//    I thought it would be, because two `impl Foo` with different methods is.
// 2. Making `Prepare` and `Print` two different traits and a supertrait
//    `Compnent: Prepare + Print`. This makes the typing very complicated, requires each compnent
//    to `impl Component for Foo {}` with an empty implementation, and makes it cumbersome for
//    those components that implement (use non-default) `print` and `prepare`.
// 3. Having a macro `#[default_prepare]` that would go on the line just above
//    `impl Component for Foo` mutating the `impl` adding the default prepare method.
//    I think this would be slightly more idomatic, but I was not smart enough to make this work.
//
// I am open to suggestions and better implementations.
